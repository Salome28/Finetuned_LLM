## Finetuned model 

I worked on creating a finetuned model to detect texts generated by Chatgpt. For this project I decided to use **the pre-trained model DistilBERT**, and the Pytorch library. The dataset is from **[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Hello-SimpleAI/HC3)**. This dataset is composed of 6 subsets (ex. Finance, Medicine, Open questions ...), each containing a set of questins with answers from humans and answers from Chatpgt. I decided to fine-tune the pre-trained model in native Pytorch to identify generated texts.
