# Python_projects

## Introduction

This folder contains different projects I've been working on, whether it was in the course of my master's degree or personnal projects I did. 
I hope this will give an idea of what I can do and what I am learning. 

## Hierarchical clustering 

For my Python course we had to develop an algorithm which would process texts taken directly from webpages (through urls) and classify in clusters. It was a very interesting project which allowed me to learn a lot and challenge myself.

## Finetuned model (IN PROGRESS)

I am currently working creating a finetuned model to detect texts generated by Chatgpt. For this project I decided to use **the pre-trained model DistilBERT**, and the Pytorch library. The dataset is from **[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Hello-SimpleAI/HC3)**. This dataset is composed of 6 subsets (ex. Finance, Medicine, Open questions ...), each containing a set of questins with answers from humans and answers from Chatpgt. I decided to fine-tune the pre-trained model in native Pytorch to identify generated texts.
