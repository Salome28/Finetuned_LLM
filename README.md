# Python_projects
## Introduction
This folder contains different projects I've been working on, whether it was in the course of my master's degree or personnal projects I did. 
I hope this will give an idea of what I can do and what I am learning. 

## Hierarchical clustering 
For my Python course we had to develop an algorithm which would process texts taken directly from webpages (through urls) and classify in clusters. It was a very interesting project which allowed me to learn a lot and challenge myself.

## Finetuned model (IN PROGRESS)
I am currently working creating a finetuned model to detect texts generated by Chatgpt. For this project I decided to use the model DistilBERT, and the Pytorch library.
