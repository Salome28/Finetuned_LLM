    "In Machine Learning (ML), a pipeline refers to a sequence of data processing steps designed to automate the workflow for training, evaluating, and deploying models. The goal is to streamline the process, ensure reproducibility, and enhance efficiency by chaining together various stages of data transformation and model training in a structured manner.\n",

    "Pipelines for inferences play a crucial role in automating and streamlining the process of making predictions on new data. They ensure that the same preprocessing and feature engineering steps applied during model training are consistently applied during inference, maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the predictions."
